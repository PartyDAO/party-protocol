# Governance Contracts

After a crowdfund has acquired its NFTs, it creates a new governance `Party`, where the NFTs are transferred. Contributors are minted NFT memberships in the new Party, containing voting power equivalent to their contribution during the crowdfund. Voting power can be used to vote on proposals, which contain possible actions for the Party to execute.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Precious**: A set of ERC721 tokens custodied by the governance contract (`Party`), conventionally acquired in the crowdfund phase. These are protected assets and are subject to extra restrictions in proposals vs other assets.
- **Governance NFT**: An NFT (ERC721) representing a membership with voting power within the governance Party.
- **Party**: The governance contract itself, which custodies the Precious, tracks voting power, manages the lifecycle of proposals, and is simultaneously the token contract for Governance NFTs.
- **Proposals**: On-chain actions that the Party wil execute, which must progress through the entire governance lifecycle in order to do so.
- **Distributions**: An (ungoverned) mechanism by which parties can distribute ETH and ERC20 tokens held by the Party to members, proportional to their relative voting power (Governance NFTs).
- **Party Hosts**: Predefined accounts that can unilaterally veto proposals in the Party. Conventionally defined when the crowdfund is created.
- **Globals**: A single contract that holds configuration values, referenced by several ecosystem contracts.
- **Proxies**: All `Party` instances are deployed as simple [`Proxy`](../contracts/utils/Proxy.sol) contracts that forward calls to a `Party` implementation contract.
- **ProposalExecutionEngine**: An upgradable contract the `Party` contract delegatecalls into that implements the logic for executing specific proposal types.

---

## Contracts

The main contracts involved in this phase are:

- `PartyFactory` ([code](../contracts/party/PartyFactory.sol))
    - Creates new proxified `Party` instances.
- `Party` ([code](../contracts/party/Party.sol))
    - The governance contract that also custodies the precious NFTs. This is also the Governance NFT 721 contract.
- `ProposalExecutionEngine` ([code](../contracts/proposals/ProposalExecutionEngine.sol))
    - An upgradable logic (and some state) contract for executing each proposal type from the context of the `Party`.
- `TokenDistributor` ([code](../contracts/distribution/TokenDistributor.sol))
    - Escrow contract for distributing deposited ETH and ERC20 tokens to members of parties.
- `Globals` ([code](../contracts/globals/Globals.sol))
    - A contract that defines global configuration values referenced by other contracts across the entire protocol.

## Party Creation

Parties are created through the `PartyFactory` contract. This is typically automatically done
by a crowdfund instance after it wins, but it is also a valid use case to interact with the PartyFactory contract directly to, for example, form a governance party around an NFT you already own.

The sequence of events is:

1. Call `PartyFactory.createParty()` defined as:
    ```solidity
    function createParty(
        address authority,
        Party.PartyOptions memory opts,
        IERC721[] memory preciousTokens,
        uint256[] memory preciousTokenIds
    )
    ```
    - `authority` will be the address that can mint tokens on the created Party. In typical flow, the crowdfund contract will set this to itself.
    - `opts` are (mostly) immutable [configuration parameters](#governance-options) for the Party, defining the Party name and symbol (the Party instance will also be an ERC721) and governance parameters.
    - `preciousTokens` and `preciousTokenIds` together define the NFTs the Party will custody and enforce extra restrictions on so they are not easily transferred out of the Party. This list cannot be changed after Party creation. Note that this list is never stored on-chain (only the hash is) and will need to be passed into the `execute()` call when executing proposals.
    - This will deploy a new `Proxy` instance with an implementation pointing to the Party contract defined by in the `Globals` contract by the key `GLOBAL_PARTY_IMPL`.
2. Transfer assets to the created Party, which will typically be the precious NFTs.
3. As the `authority`, mint Governance NFTs to members of the party by calling `Party.mint()`.
    - In typical flow, the crowdfund contract will call this when contributors burn their contribution NFTs.
4. Optionally, call `Party.abdicate()`, as the `authority`, to revoke minting privilege once all Governance NFTs have been minted.
5. At any step after the party creation, members with Governance NFTs can perform governance actions, though they may not be able to reach consensus if the total supply of voting power hasn't been minted/distributed yet.

---

## Governance Options

Parties are initialized with fixed governance options which will (mostly) never change for the Party's lifetime. They are defined in the `PartyGovernance.GovernanceOpts` struct with the fields:

- `hosts`: Array of initial party hosts. This is the only configuration that can change because hosts can transfer their privilege to other accounts.
- `voteDuration`: After being a proposal has been proposed, this is how long (in seconds) members can vote for it to pass. If this window expires before the proposal passes, it will be considered defeated.
- `executionDelay`: Duration in seconds a proposal must wait after being passed before it can be executed. This gives hosts time to veto malicious proposals that have passed.
- `passThresholdBps`: Minimum ratio of votes vs `totalVotingPower` supply to consider a proposal passed. This is expressed in basis points, i.e. `100 = 1%`
- `totalVotingPower`: Total voting power of the Party. This should be the sum of weights of all (possible) Governance NFTs given to members. Note that nowhere is this assumption enforced, as there may be use-cases for minting more than 100% of voting power, but the logic in crowdfund contracts cannot mint more than `totalVotingPower`.
- `feeBps`: The fee taken out of this Party's [distributions](#distributions) to reserve for `feeRecipient` to claim. Typically this will be set to an address controlled by PartyDAO.
- `feeRecipient`: The address that can claim distribution fees for this Party.

---

## Voting Power

### Governance NFTs

Voting power within the governance Party is represented and held by a Governance NFTs, which are ERC721s minted for each member of the Party. Each Governance NFT has a distinct voting power/weight associated with it. These cards can never be broken up or combined, but a user may own multiple Governance NFTs within a Party. The total *intrinsic* voting power a member has is the sum of all the voting power in all the Governance NFTs for that Party they possess at a given timestamp.

### Delegation

Owners of Governance NFTs can call `Party.delegateVotingPower()` to delegate their intrinsic *total* voting power across all Governance NFTs they hold, at the time of the call forward, to another account. The minter of the Governance NFT can also set an initial delegate for the owner, meaning any Governance NFTs held by the owner will be delegated by default. If a user transfers their Governance NFT, the voting power will be delegated to the recipient's existing delegate.

The chosen delegate does not need to own a Governance NFT. Delegating voting power strips the owner of their entire voting power until they redelegate to themselves, meaning they will not be able to vote on proposals created afterwards (because votes cast rely on [snapshots](#voting-power-snapshots)). Governance NFT owners can recover their voting power for future proposals if they delegate to themselves or to the zero address.

### Calculating Effective Voting Power

The effective voting power of a user is the sum of all undelegated (or self-delegated) voting power from their Governance NFTs plus the sum of all voting power delegated to them by other users.

The effective voting power of a user at a given time can be found by calling `Party.getVotingPowerAt()`.

### Voting Power Snapshots

The voting power applied when a user votes on a proposal is their effective voting power at the time the proposal was proposed. This prevents people from acquiring large amounts of Governance NFTs to influence the outcome of an active proposal. The `Party` contract appends a record of a user's total delegated (to them) and intrinsic voting power each time any of the following occurs:

- A user receives a Governance NFT (transfer or minting).
- A user transfers their Governance NFT to another user.
- A user (un)delegates their voting power.
- A user gets voting power (un)delegated to them.

When determining the effective voting power of a user, we binary search a user's voting power records for the most recent record < the proposal time.

---

## Distributions

### Mechanics

Distributions allow parties to distribute fungible tokens and ETH to party members, proportional to the voting power of their Governance NFTs.

Unlike proposals, distributions do not require any votes to pass.  Any member of the party can call `distribute` to distribute any ETH or ERC20 held by the party.

Upon `distribute` being called, the entire balance of the specified token will be transfered to the canonical `TokenDistributor` contract, and a new distribution will be created.

Each distribution has a unique id.  To interact with a distribution, you need to send in an entire `DistributionInfo` object.  The `DistributionInfo` object can be found in the `DistributionCreated` event that is emitted upon the distribution being created.

Once a distribution has been created, NFT holders can call `claim`, sending in the `DistributionInfo` as well as the PartyGovernance token id that they'd like to claim for.  Users can also leverage `batchClaim` if they'd like to claim multiple distributions in one transaction.

Every distribution can have a `feeRecipient` and `feeBps` set.  The `feeRecipient` and `feeBps` for a party's distribution will be determined by the `feeRecipient` and `feeBps` set in `GovernanceOpts` when the party was created.  In order for the `feeRecipient` to claim their fee, the fee recipient must call `claimFee`.  If the `feeRecipient` is a smart contract that is unable to call `claimFee`, the fee could be unretrievable, locked in the contract forever.

Consider the example:

```
A party is constructed with a `feeRecipient` of Bob and a `feeBps` of 250 basis points (2.5%).
Keith has 20% ownership of the party
Donna has 30% ownership of the party
Jerry has 50% ownership of the party

1000 DAI is deposited into the party contract
When Bob calls `claimFee`, they receive 25.00 DAI   (1000*0.025)
When Keith calls `claim`,  they receive 195.00 DAI  (1000*0.975)*0.2
When Donna calls `claim`,  they receive 292.50 DAI  (1000*0.975)*0.3
When Jerry calls `claim`,  they receive 487.50 DAI  (1000*0.975)*0.5
```

### Interoperability

Our `TokenDistributor` contract was designed to work with parties, but a `Distribution` can be created for any contract that implements the `ITokenDistributorParty` interface.  Implementors of the `ITokenDistributorParty` must implement `getDistributionShareOf(uint256 tokenId)` which returns how much of a distribution a particular tokenId should receive. Denominated in proportion to `1e18` (i.e. `0.5e18` represents 50%), as well as `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)` which returns the owner of a tokenId.  In the case of a `PartyGovernanceNFT`, the `getDistributionShareOf(uint256 tokenId)` defers to the ratio of the voting power of the specific `tokenId` against the `totalVotingPower`.

When creating a distribution, implementing contracts are expected to transfer the tokens prior to calling the accompanying `create{Erc20Distribution,createNativeDistribution}` method in the same transaction.

### Emergency Actions

`TokenDistributor` contains an `emergencyExecute` function that can perform an arbitrary delegatecall. This will only be called in a catastrophic scenario where the `TokenDistributor` must be decommissioned. It is restricted to the PartyDAO Multisig. The ability to call this function will be disabled after `emergencyExecuteDisabledTimestamp` has passed.

---

## Governance Lifecycle

Governance in Parties follows a fairly traditional model, revolving around passing and executing proposals. Proposals have the following properties:

- `maxExecutableTime`: A timestamp beyond which the proposal can no longer be executed. In the case of [multi-step proposals](#multi-step-proposals), this only restricts the first time the proposal is executed.
- `cancelDelay`: Number of seconds after a proposal enters the `InProgress` state after which it can be forcibly interrupted and marked complete so another proposal can be executed.
- `proposalData`: Encoded data needed to execute the proposal.
- Proposal ID: A unique identifier (counter) assigned to a proposal when it it is first proposed.

An important thing to note is that none of these proposal properties (aside from the proposal ID) are ever stored on-chain. Instead, only the hash of these fields are stored on-chain (keyed by the proposal ID) to optimize for gas usage and enforce that the properties do not change between lifecycle operations.

### Proposal Stages/Status

The stages of a proposal are defined in `PartyGovernance.ProposalStatus`:

- `Invalid`: The proposal does not exist.
- `Voting`: The proposal has been proposed (via `propose()`), has not been vetoed by a party host, and is within the voting window. Members can vote on the proposal and party hosts can veto the proposal.
- `Defeated`: The proposal has either exceeded its voting window without reaching `passThresholdBps` of votes or was vetoed by a party host.
- `Passed`: The proposal reached at least `passThresholdBps` of votes but is still waiting for `executionDelay` to pass before it can be executed. Members can continue to vote on the proposal and party hosts can veto at this time.
- `Ready`: Same as `Passed` but now `executionDelay` has been satisfied or the proposal passed unanimously. Any member may execute the proposal via `execute()`, unless `maxExecutableTime` has arrived.
- `InProgress`: The proposal has been executed at least once but has further steps to complete so it needs to be executed again. No other proposals may be executed while a proposal is in the `InProgress` status, and therefore only a single proposal may ever be in the `InProgress` status. No voting or vetoing of an `InProgress` proposal is allowed, however it may be forcibly cancelled via `cancel()` if the `cancelDelay` has arrived.
- `Complete`: The proposal was executed and completed all its steps. No voting or vetoing can occur and it cannot be cancelled nor executed again.
- `Cancelled`: The proposal was executed at least once but did not complete before `cancelDelay` seconds passed since the first execute and was forcibly cancelled.

### Making Proposals

A proposer should choose an appropriate `maxExecutableTime` and `cancelDelay`. The `proposalData` should be prefixed (like a function call) with a 4-byte `IProposalExecutionEngine.ProposalType` value followed by the ABI-encoded data specific to that proposal type (see [Proposal Types](#proposal-types)), e.g., `abi.encodeWithSelector(bytes4(ProposalType.ListOnZoraProposal), abi.encode(ZoraProposalData(...)))`.

Once ready, an active member or delegate (someone with nonzero effective voting power) can call `propose()` with the proposal properties, which will assign a unique, nonzero proposal ID and put the proposal in the `Voting` status. Proposing a proposal will also automatically cast the proposer's votes for it.

### Voting on Proposals

Any proposal in the `Voting`, `Passed`, or `Ready` status can be voted on by members and delegates via `Party.accept()`. The `accept()` function casts the caller's *total* effective voting power at the time the proposal was proposed for it. Once the total voting power cast for the proposal meets or exceeds the `passThresholdBps` ratio, given by `total cast voting power / totalVotingPower`, the proposal will enter the `Passed` state.

Members can continue to vote even beyond the `Passed` state in order to achieve a unanimous vote, which allows the proposal to bypass the `executionDelay` and unlocks specific behavior for certain proposal types. A unanimous vote condition is met when 99.99% of `totalVotingPower` has been cast for a proposal. We do not check for 100% because of possible rounding errors during minting from crowdfunds.

### Vetoes

During the `Voting`, `Passed`, and `Ready` phases of a proposal, a Party host may unilaterally veto that proposal by calling `Party.veto()`, immediately putting the proposal in the `Defeated` state. At that point, no further action can be taken on the proposal.

The rationale behind the veto power that if voting power in a Party becomes so consolidated that a bad actor can pass a malicious proposal, the party host can act as the final backstop. On the other hand, a party host can also stall a Party by vetoing every legitimate proposal, so Parties need to be extremely careful with who they agree to be hosts.

### Executing Proposals

After a proposal has achieved enough votes to pass and the `executionDelay` window has expired, or if the proposal reached unanimous consensus, the proposal can be executed by any member with currently nonzero effective voting power. This occurs via the `Party.execute()` function.

The call to `execute()` will fail if:
- The proposal has already been executed and completed (in the `Complete` status).
- The proposal has not been executed but its `maxExecutableTime` has passed.
- The proposal's execution reverts.
- There exists another proposal that has been executed but did not complete (more steps to go).

If the proposal is atomic, meaning it is a single-step proposal, it will immediately enter the `Complete` status.

#### Multi-step Proposals

Some proposal types require multiple steps and transactions to be completed. An example is the `ListOnZoraProposal` type. This proposal will first list an NFT on Zora as an auction then if the auction does not receive any bids after some amount of time or if the auction completes with a winning bid, the auction will need to be cancelled or finalized by the Party. To accomplish this, the proposal must be executed multiple times until it is considered complete and can enter the `Complete` status.

Usually further steps in a multi-step proposal requires some state to be remembered between steps. For example, the `ListOnZoraProposal` type will need to recall the ID of the Zora auction it created so it can cancel or finalize it as a final step. Rather than storing this (potentially complex) data on-chain, executing a proposal will emit a `ProposalExecuted` event with an arbitrary bytes `nextProgressData` parameter, which should be passed into the next call to `execute()` to advance the proposal. The `Party` will only store the hash of the `nextProgressData` and confirm it matches the hash of what is passed in. This data blob holds any encoded state necessary to progress the proposal to the next step.

Once the proposal has executed its final step, it will emit an empty `nextProgressData` in the `ProposalExecuted` event.

### Cancelling Proposals

There is a risk of multi-step proposals never being able to complete because they may continue to revert. Since no other proposals can be executed if another proposal is `InProgress`, a Party can become permanently stuck, unable to execute any other proposal. To prevent this scenario, proposals have a `cancelDelay` property. After a proposal has been in the `InProgress` status after this many seconds, it can be forced into a `Complete` state by calling `cancel()`. There is also a global (defined in the `Globals` contract) configuration value (`GLOBAL_PROPOSAL_MAX_CANCEL_DURATION`) which limits the `cancelDelay` to a duration not too far in the future.

Cancelling a proposal should be considered a last resort, as it can potentially leave the Party in a broken state (e.g., assets are stuck in another protocol) because the proposal was not able to properly clean up after itself. With this in mind, Parties should be careful not to pass proposals that have too short a `cancelDelay` unless they fully trust all other members.

---

## The ProposalExecutionEngine

The `Party` contract does not actually understand how to execute the different proposal types, and only perceives them as opaque binary data, `proposalData`. This `proposalData`, along with `progressData` (which is also opaque), is passed into `ProposalExecutionEngine.executeProposal()` by delegatecall.  From there, the ProposalExecutionEngine will:

1. Check that there isn't a different proposal that hasn't completed its steps.
2. If this proposal *is* the outstanding incomplete proposal, check that the hash of the `progressData` it receives matches the hash of the `progressData` emitted the last time the proposal was executed.
3. Decode the first 4 bytes of the `proposalData` to determine the [proposal type](#proposal-types).
4. Decode `proposalData` and `progressData` to execute the next step in the proposal.
5. If the proposal is not complete, return non-empty `nextProgressData`.

The rationale for separating the `ProposalExecutionEngine` from the `Party` instance is to narrow the concern of the `Party` contract with governance (which is already sufficiently complex) and, more importantly, so Parties can upgrade their `ProposalExecutionEngine` contracts to support more proposal types as the protocol matures.

`ProposalExecutionEngine` is not a pure logic contract, it does define, own, and maintain its own "private" storage state which exists in the context of the `Party`:

- The proposal ID of the outstanding/incomplete (`InProgress`) proposal.
- The hash of the `progressData` to be passed into the next call to `executeProposal()` to advance the incomplete proposal.

These storage variables begin at a constant, non-overlapping slot index to avoid collisions and simplify explicit migrations to a new storage schema if necessary. It does not access any inline storage fields defined in the `Party` contract, nor does the `Party` contract access these storage variables.

### Proposal Flags

The `Party` contract can communicate whether the proposal passed unanimously by passing in `flags` along with other proposal details. Currently the only flag supported is the `LibProposal.PROPOSAL_FLAG_UNANIMOUS` flag, which indicates the proposal reached unanimous consensus before it was first executed.

---

## Proposal Types

The Party protocol will support 5 proposal types at launch:

- [ArbitraryCalls Proposals](#arbitrarycalls-proposal-type)
- [ListOnZora Proposals](#listonzora-proposal-type)
- [ListOnOpensea Proposals](#listonopenseaport-proposal-type)
- [Fractionalize Proposals](#fractionalize-proposal-type)
- [UpgradeProposalEngineImpl Proposals](#upgradeproposalengineimpl-proposal-type)

### ArbitraryCalls Proposal Type

This proposal makes arbitrary contract calls as the Party. There are restrictions the types of calls that can be made in order to make a best effort to prevent precious NFTs from being moved out of the Party.

#### Proposal Data

The `proposalData` should be encoded as:
```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelector(
    // Prefix identifying this proposal type.
    bytes4(ProposalType.ArbitraryCallsProposal),
    // Array of ArbitraryCall structs.
    [
        ArbitraryCall(
            // The call target.
            /* address payable */ target,
            // Amount of ETH to attach to the call (from executor's wallet).
            /* uint256 */ value,
            // Calldata.
            /* bytes */ data,
            // If true, the call is allowed to fail.
            /* bool */ optional,
            // Hash of the successful return data of the call.
            // If 0x0, no return data checking will occur for this call.
            /* bytes32 */ expectedResultHash
        ),
        ...
    ]
);
```

#### Steps

This proposal is atomic, always completing in one step/execute.

- Each call is executed in the order declared.
- ETH to attach to each call must be provided by the caller of the `Party.execute()` call. If the sum of all successful calls try to consume more than `msg.value`, the entire proposal will revert.
- If a call has a non-zero `expectedResultHash` then the result of the call will be hashed and matched against this value. If they do not match, then the entire proposal will revert.
- If the call is to the `Party` itself, the entire proposal will revert.
- If the call is to the `IERC721.onERC721Received()` function, the entire proposal will revert.
    - Recall that the `Party` contract is also the Governance NFT contract so calling this function can trick someone into thinking they received a Governance NFT.
- If the proposal did not pass unanimously, extra checks are made to prevent moving a precious NFT:
    - Before executing all the calls, check which precious NFTs the Party possesses. Then after executing all the calls, ensure we still possess them or else the entire proposal will revert.
    - If the call is to `IERC721.approve()`, the target is a precious NFT token, and the token ID is a matching precious token ID, revert the entire proposal unless the operator would be set to the zero address.
    - If the call is to `IERC721.setApprovalForAll()` and the target is a precious NFT token, revert the entire proposal unless the approval status would be set to `false`.
- Unanimous proposals will not have restrictions on moving precious tokens or setting allowances for them.

### ListOnZora Proposal Type

This proposal type lists an NFT held by the Party on a Zora V1 auction.

#### Proposal Data

The `proposalData` should be encoded as:
```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelector(
    // Prefix identifying this proposal type.
    bytes4(ProposalType.ListOnZoraProposal),
    ZoraProposalData(
        // The minimum bid (ETH) for the NFT.
        /* uint256 */ listPrice,
        // How long before the auction can be cancelled if no one bids.
        /* uint40 */ timeout,
        // How long the auction lasts once a person bids on it.
        /* uint40 */ duration,
        // The token contract of the NFT being listed.
        /* IERC721 */ token,
        // The token ID of the NFT being listed.
        /* uint256 */ tokenId
    )
);
```

#### Steps

This proposal always has two steps:
1. Transfer the token to the Zora auction house contract and create an auction with `listPrice` reserve price and `duration` auction duration (which starts after someone places a bid).
    - This will emit the next `progressData`:
    ```solidity
    abi.encode(
        // The current step.
        ListOnZoraStep.ListedOnZora,
        ZoraProposalData(
            // The Zora auction ID.
            /* uint256 */ auctionId,
            // The minimum time when the auction can be cancelled.
            /* minExpiry */ minExpiry
        )
    );
    ```
2. Either cancel or finalize the auction.
    - Cancel the auction if the auction was never bid on and `minExpiry` time has passed. This will also return the NFT to the party.
    - Finalize the auction if someone has bid on it and the auction `duration` has passed. This will transfer the top bid amount (in ETH) to the Party. It is also possible someone else finalized the auction for us, in which case the Party already has the ETH and this step becomes a no-op.

### ListOnOpensea Proposal Type

This proposal type *ultimately* tries to list an NFT held by the Party on OpenSea (Seaport 1.1). Because OpenSea listings are limit orders, there is no mechanism for on-chain price discovery (unlike a Zora auction). So to mitigate a malicious proposal listing a precious NFT for far below its actual worth, this proposal type will first place the NFT in a Zora auction before creating an OpenSea listing. The durations for this mandatory Zora step are defined by the global values `GLOBAL_OS_ZORA_AUCTION_TIMEOUT` and `GLOBAL_OS_ZORA_AUCTION_DURATION`.

#### Proposal Data

The `proposalData` should be encoded as:
```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelector(
    // Prefix identifying this proposal type.
    bytes4(ProposalType.ListOnOpenseaProposal),
    OpenseaProposalData(
        // The price (in ETH) to sell the NFT.
        // This is also the reserve bid for the Zora auction.
        /* uint256 */ listPrice,
        // How long the listing is valid for.
        /* uint40 */ duration,
        // The NFT token contract.
        /* IERC721 */ token,
        // the NFT token ID.
        /* uint256 */ tokenId,
        // Fees the taker must pay when filling the listing.
        /* uint256[] */ fees,
        // Respective recipients for each fee.
        /* address payable[] */ feeRecipients
    )
);
```

#### Steps

This proposal has between 2-3 steps:

1. If the proposal did not pass unanimously and the `token` + `tokenId` is precious:
    1. Transfer the token to the Zora auction house contract and create an auction with `listPrice` reserve price and `GLOBAL_OS_ZORA_AUCTION_DURATION` auction duration (which starts after someone places a bid).
        - This will emit the next `progressData`:
        ```solidity
        abi.encode(
            // The current step.
            ListOnOpenseaStep.ListedOnZora,
            ZoraProposalData(
                // The Zora auction ID.
                /* uint256 */ auctionId,
                // The minimum time when the auction can be cancelled.
                /* minExpiry */ minExpiry
            )
        );
        ```
    2. Either cancel or finalize the auction.
        - Cancel the auction if the auction was never bid on and `progressData.minExpiry` has passed. This will also return the NFT to the party. Proceed to 2.1.
        - Finalize the auction if someone has bid on it and the auction duration has passed. This will transfer the top bid amount (in ETH) to the Party. It is also possible someone else finalized the auction for us, in which case the Party already has the ETH and this step becomes a no-op. *The proposal will be complete at this point with no further steps.*
2. If the proposal passed unanimously or if the `token` + `tokenId` is not precious:
    1. Grant OpenSea an allowance for the NFT and create a non-custodial OpenSea listing for the NFT with price `listPrice` + any extra `fees` that is valid for `duration` seconds.
        - This will emit the next `progressData`:
        ```solidity
        abi.encode(
            // The current step.
            ListOnOpenseaStep.ListedOnOpenSea,
            OpenseaProgressData(
                // Hash of the OS order that was listed.
                /* bytes32 */ orderHash,
                // Expiration timestamp of the listing.
                /* uint40 */ expiry
            )
        );
        ```
3. Clean up the OpenSea listing, emitting an event with the outcome, and:
    - If the order was filled, the Party has the `listPrice` ETH, the NFT allowance was consumed, and there is nothing left to do.
    - If the order expired, no one bought the listing and the Party still owns the NFT. Revoke OpenSea's token allowance.

### Fractionalize Proposal Type

This proposal type fractionalizes an NFT on Fractional V1, minting Fractional ERC20 tokens claimable by all party members via distributions.

#### Proposal Data

The `proposalData` should be encoded as:
```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelector(
    // Prefix identifying this proposal type.
    bytes4(ProposalType.FractionalizeProposal),
    FractionalizeProposalData(
        // The ERC721 token contract to fractionalize.
        /* IERC721 */ token;
        // The ERC721 token ID to fractionalize.
        /* uint256 */ tokenId;
        // The starting reserve price for the fractional vault.
        /* uint256 */ listPrice;
    )
);
```

#### Steps

This proposal is atomic, completing in one step/execute:
1. Create a new Fractional V1 vault around `token` + `tokenId`.
    - Reserve price will be set to the proposal's `listPrice`.
    - Curator will be set to `address(0)`.
    - `totalVotingPower` fractional ERC20 tokens will be minted and held by the Party, which can later be claimed through an ERC20 distribution.

### UpgradeProposalEngineImpl Proposal Type

This proposal type upgrades the `ProposalExecutionEngine` instance for a party to the latest version defined in the `GLOBAL_PROPOSAL_ENGINE_IMPL` global value.

#### Proposal Data

The `proposalData` should be encoded as:
```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelector(
    // Prefix identifying this proposal type.
    bytes4(ProposalType.UpgradeProposalEngineImpl),
    // Arbitrary data needed by the new ProposalExecutionEngine to migrate.
    /* bytes */  initData
);
```

#### Steps

This proposal is always atomic and completes in a single step/execute.

- The current `ProposalExecutionEngine` implementation address is looked up in the `Globals` contract, keyed by `GLOBAL_PROPOSAL_ENGINE_IMPL`.
- The current `ProposalExecutionEngine` implementation address used by the Party is kept at an explicit, non-overlapping storage slot and will be overwritten with the new implementation address (see [ProposalStorage](../contracts/proposals/ProposalStorage.sol)).
- The Party will `delegatecall` into the new `ProposalExecutionEngine`'s `initialize()` function, passing in the old implementation's address and `initData` migration data.
    - This gives new implementations some ability to perform state migrations. E.g., if the storage schema or semantics changes.
    - `initData` is provided by the proposer as a possible hint to the migration process.

## Emergency Execution

By default when a party is created, there is an `emergencyExecute` function that can be used by the PartyDAO multisig in the case of an emergency. This function can execute arbitrary bytecode and withdraw ETH. This emergency power can be revoked by any party host, or by the PartyDAO multisig itself.
